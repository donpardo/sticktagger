# tags music files based on directory structure using Artist/Album/Song.mp3
# example:
# the file Beatles/Born To Run/I Wanna Be Sedated.mp3 would be tagged as follows:
# Artist: Beatles

# All other tags are lefts as is.

# We assume that the user is interested in just finding a song, not maintaining
